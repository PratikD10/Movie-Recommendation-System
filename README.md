# Movie-Recommendation-System
Welcome to my Movie Recommendation System! This project leverages content based filtering algorithms to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences.

To run the Project you need to open the whole folder in your IDE and then open the MRS.py file.

Once you've done that you need to install Streamlit if it's not available by using this command in the Terminal:
pip install streamlit

Once you've installed streamlit you can the run the Application with this command in the Terminal:
streamlit run MRS.py

You're now in the Recommendation System interface and can type for favorite movie in the text box and click on recommend which will give you 5 similar movies you may like.
